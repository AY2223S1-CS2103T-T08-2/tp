## Notes

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### Setting deadlines to a task: `task do ... by/`

You can use the `task do ... by/` command to set (or remove) a deadline for some task.

Format: `task do TASK_INDEX [by/DATE]...`
- The `task do` command sets the deadline specified by `DATE` to the task at the specified `TASK_INDEX` from the task list.
- You can use plain English to describe the intended deadline, such as `today`, `tomorrow`, `next Thursday`, `14 November`, and so on.
- If the application is unable to determine a date from your input, an error message will be displayed, and you will be prompted to try a different input.
- To **remove** the deadline from a task, you can use the special character `?`.

Examples:
* `task do 1 by/tomorrow` sets the deadline for the 1st task in the list to tomorrow.
* `task do 1 by/?` **removes** the deadline from the 1st task in the list.


### Sorting tasks by deadline: `task sort`

Sorts the task list by deadline.

Format: `task sort`


### Filtering the Tasks List: `task list`

You can use the `task list` command to focus only on tasks that match your specified filter requirements.

Format: `task list [KEYWORD] [#PROJECT]... [@PERSON_INDEX]... [before/ DATE] [after/ DATE]`
- The `task list` command accepts **optional** parameters that can filter tasks by their description, project, due date or assigned contacts.
- If you do not specify any filters (i.e. `task list`), the command returns **all incomplete** tasks.

#### Filtering by Description
- The `KEYWORD` parameter allows you to search for tasks that contain `KEYWORD`.
  - For example, `task list fix` returns all **incomplete** tasks whose description contains the keyword `fix`.

#### Filtering by Project
- The `#` parameter allows you to search for tasks that are assigned to **any** of the project(s) you specify.
  - For example, `task list #CS2101 #CS2103T` returns all **incomplete** tasks that are **either** under the project `CS2101` **or** `CS2103T`.

#### Filtering by Assigned Contact(s)
- The `@` parameter allows you to search for tasks that are assigned to **all** the contact(s) you specify.
    - For example, `task list @1 @2` returns all **incomplete** tasks that are assigned to **both** the 1st and 2nd persons from the address book.

#### Filtering by Deadline
- The `before/` and `after/` parameters allow you to specify a date range to filter the tasks by, according to their deadline.
  - For example, `task list before/ next Monday after/ tomorrow` returns all **incomplete** tasks whose deadline is, well, after tomorrow but before next Monday.

#### Filtering by Completion Status
- Notice that the command seems to always return **incomplete** tasks. You can choose to opt out of this default behaviour with the `-a` parameter.
  - For example, `task list -a` returns all tasks, **both** completed and incomplete ones,
- Similarly, the `-c` filter allows you to search through **completed** tasks only.
  - For example, `task list -c` returns all **completed** tasks.


### Assigning contacts to a task: `task assign`

Assigns or unassigns the specified persons from address book to a task from task panel.

Format: `task assign TASK_INDEX [+@PERSON_INDEX]…​ [+@PERSON_NAME]…​ [-@PERSON_INDEX]…​ [-@PERSON_NAME]…​`
* +@: Assigns the persons at the specified PERSON_INDEXs, or with the PERSON_NAME, from `address book` to task at the specified TASK_INDEX from `task list`.
* -@: Unassigns the persons at the specified PERSON_INDEXs, or with the PERSON_NAME, from `address book` from task at the specified TASK_INDEX from `task list`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A task can have any number of assigned contacts (including 0)
</div>

Examples:
* `task assign 1 +@1 +@Alex Yeoh -@Bernice Yu` assigns the 1st person and "Alex Yeoh" from the address book to the 1st task from task list, and unassigns "Bernice Yu" from the same task.


### Editing a task: `task edit`

Edits an existing task in the task list.

Format: `task edit TASK_INDEX [ti/TITLE] [by/DEADLINE] [#/PROJECT] [+@PERSONS_INDEX] ... [-@PERSONS_INDEX]...`

* Edits the person at the specified `TASK_INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing contacts, adding or removing contacts is cumulative. Not specifying any contacts to add will not change the data. Specify `+@PERSON_INDEX` to add and `-@PERSON_INDEX` to delete a contact.

Format: `task project`


### Exiting the program : `exit`
